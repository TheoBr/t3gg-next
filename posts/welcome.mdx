This is long, long overdue.

I'm Theo. I am nerdy about a lot of stuff. I want to start writing more about the things I'm nerdy about. I made this blog to host the things I write.

This blog is also built on things I'm nerdy about. My personal site was previously a trim [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) app, shipping ~200kb down the pipe. I'm _way too proud_ that this site, blog and all, is under 100kb.

tl;dr on the tech - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) rewrite deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

It's nothing too fancy. Still pumped about the [lighthouse score tho](/images/lighthouse-scores.png)

I'll likely write more on the tech itself in the future - but for now, know I'm loving this stack and highly recommend it.

Next post will be the AirPods Max review, [follow me on Twitter to see when that's out](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg)

Thanks for stopping by ðŸ™‚

-Theo
