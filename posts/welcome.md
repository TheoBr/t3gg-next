This is long, long overdue.

I'm Theo. I am nerdy about a lot of stuff. I want to start writing more about the things I'm nerdy about. I made this blog to host the things I write.

This blog is also built on things I'm nerdy about. My personal site was previously a trim [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) app, shipping ~200kb down the pipe. I'm _way too proud_ that this site, blog and all, is under 100kb.

If you haven't guessed, this was a [Next JS rewrite](https://nextjs.org/). I'll likely write more on these in the future - but for now know I have no regrets in my move to this tech. ðŸ™‚
