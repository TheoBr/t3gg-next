Contrary to what many like to think, [programming is not for everyone](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/12/coding-jobs-wont-save-coal-country.html). I'm incredibly lucky to love my work. I spend...too much time thinking about _why_ I love coding. What keeps me so engaged? Why do I enjoy this so much?

### The Grind

I like learning how to do things.

My skateboard was a fantastic tool in this pursuit of _learning how to do as much shit as I possibly could._ Like, _the best possible tool_. I vividly remember creating spreadsheets to track every version of every trick I knew. _Regular, fakie, nollie, switch, backside, frontside, 180, 360, shuvit, kickflip, heelflip..._

Each combination was a new challenge. A new opportunity. A new series of failures.

_Fakie Backside 180 Kickflip._ An earlier battle in my skate career. Ride backwards, turn your shoulders, pop the board as you lift your front shoulder (well, back shoulder in this case, remember you're backwards), flick your right ankle as you begin to leave the ground.

_Fall_. Again. And again. And again.

Every attempt is a chance to bail. Every bail is a chance to break a bone. Every bail is also a chance to learn why the board and the body didn't do what you expected.

Every attempt is a chance to do something you've never done before. Every one of those never been done tricks (NBDs) is an achievement. Most NBDs are things _you_ have never done, but over time, you might start doing tricks _nobody_ has ever done.

If the weather allows, I can grab my skateboard at any hour, go outside, and _do something that nobody has done before_.

### When The Weather Gets Backside

Something about computers filling the space the skateboard can't.

### The Gateway Drug: Minecraft

### The Common Root: Video Games
