> Sometimes it's important to do the thing that feels a little stupid.

**I'm starting a company.**

How did I get here? I'm just a music-loving skate nerd from a small farm town. My first "real job," a contract dev role, was more a generous gift than an earned position. If the hiring manager didn't happen to have the same taste in music, I _probably wouldn't have gotten the role._

Oh also — worth mentioning that the role was on the **Creative Team at Twitch**. Fresh out of university, with no experience at all, I got to _write the code that ran Twitch's marathon_, including Power Rangers, YuGiOh, and the viral [Bob Ross](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/09/after-pulling-in-5-6m-viewers-twitch-is-keeping-bob-ross-on-the-air/), which [still runs today](https://twitch.tv/bobross).

I stayed at Twitch for four years, hopping from team to team, building dozens of projects I'm proud of to this day. It's hard to put into words how much I was able to learn here. One lesson stuck out — I learned I could build some pretty damn good stuff.

### The First Resignation

The realization my aspirations had outgrown my role was a long, painful process. My last year was particularly rough. I saw so many points that hurt both creators and users. I wanted to _destroy, rebuild, and improve everywhere I could._ My ambitions helped me get some [pretty](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/03/31/introducing-mod-view/) [cool](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/soundtrack) [stuff](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/studio) out, but I was getting tired. My work was no longer fulfilling. My time wasn't spent building; it was spent convincing people that we needed to _build and ship the right things_.

My desire to build overpowered the comfort I got from my role at Twitch. One of my favorite sites from my childhood, Turntable, announced they were coming back and had begun hiring. The opportunity to build was being dangled in front of me, and I had to bite. I left Twitch on the last Friday in January 2021 and started at TTFM Labs the next Monday.

### Startup Life

Going from a 2,000-person company to a two-person company is, uh, _quite an adjustment_.

My initial role was to build, of all things, the Android app. We had a working prototype within a week. 3 days later, we had ported to iOS successfully. The web app (written by contractors at the time) was the next target. Since the mobile packages were built in a portable fashion, we were able to replace it within another 2 weeks.

I was building again. Faster than ever. I was hooked.

We started hiring. I helped make a great team. We were shipping at an alarming rate, recreating the music sharing experience I missed from my high school days.

_The feeling of "solving problems from scratch" motivated me to build like I had never built before._ I wish I could say this continued past the first two months.

### Losing Focus

It didn't take long to run into some familiar red tape. Our backend was labeled by leadership as "do not touch." All of the outages, bugs, and other weird behaviors became client-side problems we had to solve in increasingly obtuse ways.

In a short time, my role transitioned away from "solving technical problems to build a better product". I was back in the bureaucracy. The foundation we were building on was weak, and we were being asked to keep building higher. I pushed for us to refocus, reinforcing what we had before the tech collapsed under the weight of feature creep.

It took a while, but they listened. We replaced our monstrous 7,000 LOC socket server with a minimal, maintainable implementation under 350 LOC. This was a huge win, but I had become disillusioned by the process.

_I had spent almost half a year justifying code that took under 10 hours to write._

### Finding My Drive Again

My work was no longer providing the fulfillment I had quit Twitch to pursue. I needed to build.

I spent a week putting [way too much time into a web game about Dogecoin](https://doge.t3.gg/). It was the most fulfillment I had felt in months. It also reinforced the big lesson from Twitch: _I can go from concept to product pretty damn quick_.

Speaking of Twitch, I still was a regular user. The problems I wanted to solve hadn't gone anywhere. From the inside, creator pain points were rarely be considered beyond dinner discussions. From the outside, those same problems stuck out like weeds, begging to be cut.

Multi-person content seemed particularly hard to create, so I started a new project — [**Round**](https://round.t3.gg/). In a few days, I had something usable. A week later it, was broaching on useful. Like most of my side projects, I started showing some friends. Unlike most of my side projects, _they all wanted to use it as soon as possible._

### Riding The Wave

To put it bluntly, Round is the most fulfilling work I've done in awhile. Our first partners have been using it for almost a month now, and our tech has already powered some [pretty](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1116432396) [cool](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1123526377) [stuff](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1133166999?filter=highlights&sort=time).

Round solves a problem that's been ignored for years — creating live content with multiple people. This is an enticing, exciting, poorly-explored problem space that I'm hyped to be part of.

_That said, it's only the beginning._

### T3 Tools

I want to make tools that inspire a sense of craftsmanship. It feels a bit dumb to do this, which means it might be worth it.

**I'm leaving TTFM Labs to start T3 Tools Inc.**

We have a lot to build. [Round](https://round.t3.gg/) is just the start. If all goes well, it will enable me to build the toolbox that powers the future of live content creation.

Live creators work so damn hard. I want to help build a future where their tools work with them, not against them.
