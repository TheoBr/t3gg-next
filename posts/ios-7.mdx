### A New Role For Design

Remember the old skeuomorphic design of iOS past? Let's explore.

The compass is a great start point. Wood grain, paper-like body, gold border with a soft light shining in an uneven pattern.

How about the notes app? The yellow notebook paper is great, but the footer UI with hand-drawn icons makes it.

> Skeuomorph: derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that were inherent to the original

Skeuomorphism was the design language of choice for all of Apple's software for decades. The above examples are meant to highlight this focus on bringing the real world items into the digital realm. So...what was the point?

**_The role of design was to convince users that software could replace the analog devices it emulated_**

Apple's designers were competing with the world we lived in. The compass had to look like a compass so you'd be comfortable leaving your compass at home. The calculator had to look like a calculator to battle your grade school teacher's insistence that "you won't always have a calculator on you". The calendar had to look like a calendar so you'd consider breaking a decades-long habit of updating the family wall calendar, often passed down through generations.

The items Apple competed with were deeply engrained in our culture. Our behaviors. Our identities. Developers had to convince the _entire world_ that their digital solutions could replace their analog lives.

By the early 2010's, they had succeeded.

### What Happens When You Win

In under half a decade, the iPhone went from a wild idea and often-referenced punchline to the standard for how people communicated.

The first victims were the obvious ones. iPod sales plummeted. Blackberry went on life support. TomTom moved out of consumer GPS sales. These were all modern, digital devices. These were all obvious casualties.

The surprises came in the _old things_ the iPhone began replacing.

Books, compasses, notebooks, alarm clocks, address books, cameras, and so much more. The iPhone had quickly succeeded in replacing so many of the every day items we engaged with.

They won. The users were convinced. If the iPhone _could_ do something, _we were willing to try_.

What would they do with this newfound power? Simplify.
